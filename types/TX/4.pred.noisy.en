I'm from Dair 8 to John John.
I just did 8 to John John.
I used to take one or two times a month, but for the last six months or a year, I can't control myself when I drink alcohol.
I've had a meltdown with John.
I wake up a minute before the alarm rings.
This is an interesting documentary.
I'm barely eating and fat while those who eat more than five people don't earn a pound.
You've got me so drunk with your John John whatever, but I'm gonna download it.
Oh, yes, tonight John John.
I can't sleep, I can't sleep, and if I make a sound, I go out with a bat...
I'm telling you, they're doubled by John 90 minutes!
I'm fucking John the Faggots right now.
He told me it was normal, too, and it was gonna come down,
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
I tell myself that when I get home I can watch John John it motivates me
But if he dies, the show won't be the same ending... I don't know it can't be John John without John.
For my anguish attacks, he's prescribing John an anti-anxiolitite for my anxiety,
Give us his private life when he can't even take care of France.
And my mom took it pretty well. She knew I was shady.
So I forced myself to resist the product,
I'm introducing a buddy of mine to a friend of mine and they're bails without me.
I'm meeting a friend of mine, and they're bails without me.
In John John when my John is 10 I'm so happy, Mr.
We barely saw it, but this is the class of the really big ones.
I'm afraid I'm calling my mother... because the colleagues weren't there...
Yep, and it'll be a nice gift for you too.
My John gets empty after I get bored and I get lonely, but it's mostly during the holidays, but it doesn't count.
My John's empty after I'm bored, and I'm lonely, but it's mostly during the holidays, but it doesn't matter.
But I can't live there because I have anxiety attacks.
I'm at John's and someone takes 20 minutes to order a salad or an ice cream.
I'm gonna go watch John John John.
John "What did you say to the Algerian flag there?" John "But I was talking to John - "Yeah, be smart!"
At the end of the afternoon, two other colleagues came to join us and we decided to take the John on the beach.
I'm looking at John while I'm waiting for John John's undertaking.
The day comes and I start to fall asleep because I had just realized there was nothing,
There's no John.
No matter what happens, we're all proud to be born despite defeat!
Saturday morning after a dark night I leave to work just from 9:00 to 12 in the afternoon.
I don't know about you, but seeing the joy of big players like John, John, I think it's beautiful.
Does anyone have that problem?
I just saw John and John. I can't.
I just saw John and John. I can't.
Quiet, you sons of bitches while you leave me as a dog at the workshop my John John John's score is just up.

I actually live with my mom, but I found an apartment.
This weekend I'm invited to a birthday party and I'm very scared,
In high school you have couples on one side, the mdl people, and then you get the John John Johns.
I've still got my job, I've got no friends but two cousins and my brother away from me,
Is it John, or did John score?
I hesitated at first and then I thought I'd take it.
I'm making some papers for next weekend.
If I've seen you this summer at John, you're so beautiful, you're amazing.
Sisi, I saw you this summer at John. You're so beautiful.
Good memory I think, will you come back next year?
Good memory I think, will you come back next year?
Thank you and all of you.
They pollute the John they stay at home
I didn't even know she had those 22 years, John.
Happy birthday. I love you more than anything enjoys your 22 years.
I'm so psyched, it's just someone who got the wrong number.
I'm so psyched, it's like it was just someone who got the wrong number. I don't know.
There's one thing that's paying me more than when I'm packing.
There's one thing that's paying me more than when I lend my stuff.
Yes to you, John, victory even though I know you don't care, but I can't wait to give you the price.

I hope he doesn't get a message on his phone when someone writes a Facebook message.

My sister's going to kill me. I sing when she wants to sleep.
