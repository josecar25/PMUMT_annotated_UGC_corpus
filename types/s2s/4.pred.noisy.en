I've come eight to John John.
Jvien to do eight to John John.
I used to take one or two times a month, but for six months, I can't control myself when I drink alcohol.
That's it. I've had it with John John.
I wake up a minute before the alarm rings
He's the illusion of what he's not supposed to be.
I hardly eat and fati while those who eat more than five people won't win 1g.
You've raised me so much with your John John I don't know what, but I'm gonna download it.
Oh, there it is, John John, and it's motivating me a little bit more!
I can't sleep, I cogit and the slightest noise I'm going out with a bat...
I'll tell you what's going on with John 90 minutes!
I'm making John John the fags right now.
He said it was normal, too, and it was going to go down,
Wait, the nantays thought they'd go to prolongation?
I'm telling you, when I come home, I can watch John John, it motivates me.
But if he dies, the show will be more the same... I don't know it's possible John John without John.
For my anguish attacks, he's prescribing John an antixolitite antiximity at last,
We're taking out his private life when he can't even take care of France.
And my mother took it pretty well at last she knew I was fishy...
So I was forced to resist the product,
I'm introduceing a friend to a friend of mine and they're making a page without me.
I'd like to introduce a friend to one of my buddies, and they're making a couple of bucks without me.
In John John when my John is 10 I'm too happy, Mrd.
But from Paris, double of John 1-2 we almost haven't seen it, but that's the class of the big ones!
panicked I'd call my mother... because the coworkers weren't here...
And it'll be a nice gift for you, too.
My John's empty after I get fucked up and I feel lonely, but it's especially on vacation, but it's not the case that matters too much.
My John's empty after I get fucked up, and I'm lonely, but it's especially on vacation, but it's not the case that counts too much.
But I can't live there because I'm having anxiety attacks.
I'm at the John and someone takes 20 minutes to order a salad or an ice cream. I'm like John.
I'm gonna go watch John John.
John, what did you insult the algerian flag here, John, but I was talking to John - that's it.
End of after noon, tonight comes two more colleagues to join us, and we decided to take the John on the beach (Personally I wasn't reassuring)
I'm looking at John, waiting for John John's title.
The day gets up and I start to fall asleep because I just realized that there was nothing,
There's no John.
Whatever happens, we're all proud of being born despite defeat!
Saturday morning after a white night I'm going to work just the morning of 9 pm to 12 pm in the afternoon,
I don't know you, but seeing the joy of the great players like John, John, John, I think it's beautiful.
Somebody's got this problem.
I just saw John and John I can't.
I just saw John and John I can't.
Can't you talk to me like that? I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Don't worry, I'll tell you what I'll do when you leave me as a son of a bitch when you leave me as a dog at the workshop.
I'm currently living at my mother's, but I found an apartment.
This weekend I'm invited to a birthday and I'm very scared,
In high school, you have the couples on one side, the people of the melts, and then you have those who play John John.
I still have my job, I don't have a buddy except two cousins and my brother who are away from me,
John, or John who scored?
I hesitated at the beginning and then I thought I'd take it.
I'll set up some firecrackers for next weekend.
If I've seen you this summer to John your too beautiful
Sisi, I've seen you this summer. You're too beautiful.
Good memory, I think, will you come back next year?
Good memory, I think you'll come back next year?
A thousand thanks and to you as well as all of us.
They polluted the John they're staying at home.
I didn't even know she had those 22 years ago, John.
Happy birthday, my life I love you more than everything else.
I'm psyching too much, it's just that it was just someone who got the wrong number I don't know I should've answered the fucking phone.
I psyched too much, it was just someone who was wrong with the wrong number. I don't know I should've answered the fucking phone.
There's something that's selling me the most is when I pack my things.
There's something that's selling me the most when I get my things ready.
It's up to you, John, even if I know somewhere you don't care, but I can't wait for you to get the prize.

I hope he doesn't get a message on his phone when someone's writing a Faceboook message.

My sister, she's going to kill me when she wants to sleep.
