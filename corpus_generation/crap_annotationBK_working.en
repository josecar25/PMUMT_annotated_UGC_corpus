Zlatan knows the wrapping up schedule of the regional press, indeed
Personally I don't play Flappy Bird, and I'm fine with that!
40 at flappy bird, so hoooooooooooot! WWW77
I tell myself the product has to come down because I won't be able to fight as is
I was convinced Candy Crush was a true cancer, until the day I discovered Flappy Bird.
What did I say before the game???? ZLATAN's double WWW49 … JohnDoe757_3
But since when there are levels in flappy bird damn o_o I think I downloaded the credits :(
I just did 8 at flappy bird lool
Tonight, there's Teen Wolf. My Tuesday is a success!
To succeed at Flappy Bird, you have to become its friend.
Flappy bird that's a game worth bashing one's iPhone against the wall true lool.
TEEN WOLF TONIIIIIIGHT!
on friday night everything was alright
#ItAnnoysMeWhen when one thinks oneself better than the others.
For them it's Teen Wolf now but for us it's... TEEN WOLF TONIGHT WHEN COMING BACK FROM SCHOOL OR WORK HAPPY TIMES!
In short, I'll watch teen wolf this afternoon and then I'll work
I used to take some 1 or 2 times a month top, But since about 6 months and even 1 year I can't manage to control myself when I drink alcohol.
#ItAnnoysMeWhen the bell ending the class rings, and the teacher still keeps you to finish his class --'
Ok Teen Wolf is in TT it means something crazy awesome is going on so I'm hesitant to watch now!
There now I cracked with flappy bird
people that love me hate me when I've been drinking
I have a dilemma: do I start Teen Wolf knowing that I'll have to stop in the middle of the episode to go to class? AAARGH
#ItAnnoysMeWhen I wakeup 1 min before the alarm clock rings
#ItAnnoysMeWhen I bump into the post in #flappybird
This docu calls to mind. It's an illustration of what the Republic ought not to be:discrimination,violence,bitterness.#infrarouge @France2tv
Between Twitter and Flappy Bird... I think birds are really trying to fuck up my social life. <
LDC is interested in CDL. Interesting. RT "@JohnDoe806: Zlatan struck twice as PSG took their place in the French League Cup final"
tonight when I get home I'll watch the new teen wolf episode
Thats it flappy bird is marketed in Italy because of me...
I'm so hopeless at Flappy Bird

#ItAnnoysMeWhen I barely eat and get fat while those who eat like 5 people don't gain 1g
Well demna tedi teen wolf takes too much time to load I'll watch it tomorrow 😴
Basically, the more you will let yourself get worked up with these conditions, the worst they will become.
We're 11 in class, we're smoking and having a flappy bird contest... a salute
You annoyed me so much with your flappy bird whatever. But I'm going to download it. 😈
Wow Teen Wolf in #TT that means this show must be doing pretty good o.O
I must make them shut up these f... labelling people,
I can't drink normally
Nantes guys they make 27 passes in one half and they're saying things about penalties, that there was hope and all that pff #PoorSoccer #L1Mentality
I've got Teen Wolf everywhere in my tv omg stop stop I won't survive
yes it's true I analyzed it too
The star wars saga so mythical #StarWarsV can't wait for next week #Nostalgy
JohnDoe445's record at flappy Bird is 6 LOOOOL SHE SUCKS
Zlatan's zen is small compared to his talent
The one who tells me he or she can score more than 30 at #FlappyBird is the biggest bullshitter ever known on Earth
Hey strangle people remotely it's classy @DarkVador_Off #StarWarsV
The credits song is normal again hallelujah #TeenWolf
I'm going to see an Ophtalmologist in early january but I don't think it's going to make anything better,

I ask them whether the guys are following us,
I never took everyday nor being super addict

Assist from Lucas, nice header of Zlatan Ibrahimovic! Nantes 1-2 PSG 91st minute
Zlatan doesn't say it but I was the one who teached him his push kick!
Roman Godfrey watched Teen Wolf (2011) • S03E17 Silverfinger and is back drawing circles on his favorite gypsy.

Actors live tweeting the episode while I am going to high school <<<<<< #TeenWolf
Well Tyler saying " see you soon" to an actor of season 4, it's a good omen for his Character nah? #TeenWolf
We learn that shitty media replaced "March for equality and against racism " by " March of the Beurs " #infrarouge
Tuesday night = Teen Wolf = may the day end quickly
I don't even download Flappy Bird, or I will smash my iPhone.
often it gives me quite the headaches...
May the force be with us #StarWarsV #Romain
#Zlatan scored 4 goals in 2 games against #Nantes WWW47
Actually the hardest moment to hold up mentally is at night
my cousin plays flappy bird loooooooooool she's more hopeless than me
JohnDoe389 who can't score more than 1 at FlappyBird ... lmaooooo
Flappy Bird dis game requires the mental focus of a jedi and strong nerves.
you too are asking yourself the same question?
#ItAnnoysMeWhen someone criticises Rihanna
Wait Wait , Nantes thought they were going through overtime? #LOL

I feel like @ouifm , at night, it's like a #ZLATAN attack!!!!!! It's a win ;)
Flappy bird I talked about it 3 months ago I didn't annoy you, you dogs you can't stop
SOMEONE TO FANGIRL WITH ME ABOUT TEEN WOLF IS REQUESTED THANKS

A guy in Stockholm found Zlatan's credit cards in a cab.. Only blacks.. Chill WWW87
I always spend my civics hours playing Candy Crush and Flappy Bird
on the contrary thanks for answering Cllaude530 1 er
41 at flappy bird... it's gonna be tough to do better x)
A guy took a cab in Stockholm a few days ago and he stumbled upon Zlatan's wallet WWW48
But idk, if he dies, the show will not be the same c'mon... I don't know it's not possible teen wolf without stiles

my Teen Wolf episode is downloading **
I'm watching Teen Wolf with my cat, she's purring in her sleep while I'm dying from feelings in front of the twins
Flappy Bird or the type of game that is a pain in the ass game but you try to beat your score anyway!!
I'm in a dilemma between pushing the "stop" button of the bus or going on with my flappy bird game
I scored 52 at flappy bird, I plan to organize a party to celebrate.
Loooool! Zlatan scored, I'm hearing my neighbor shouting! He's crazy
stop drinking and the problem will be settled
#ItAnnoysMeWhen #françoishollande brings up his private life when he can't even manage to deal with France
We're in finaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaal  ! Thank you Zlatan Ibrahimović ♥
I have made my mistakes. But downloading Flappy Bird, this, I will never forgive myself for it.

#ItAnnoysMeWhen I'm in the bathroom I'm listening to cauet and I drop my iPhone
He is the true Z. Not Zlatan. Thanks. ❤️ WWW50
#ItAnnoysMeWhen I see buddies laughing along with people I don't like
Curiosity kills duh! Without meaning to do it I saw the next episodes of #TeenWolf without seeing the ones before 😓😢😨😭
But now I'm gonna watch a bit Teen Wolf or Pretty Little Liars.
Zlatan wiped out all the Nantes people tonight. It's crazy how much he's mean to you 👍
Even Buddhists don't have this level of concentration @JohnDoe405 @JohnDoe406 #flappybird WWW76
so that means I forced myself to resist the product,
Zlatan was born to score
#ItAnnoysMeWhen I introduce a friend to one of my friends and they do stuff without me
Nope Nope Nope NOOOOPE NOOOPE... In short, it's the end of the Teen Wolf episode
it's a bit more than a friend to me who celebrate his birthday,
Before it was doodle jump now they break our balls with flappy bird lol pathetic!
PREPARE YOUR DOCUMENTS TO WATCH #infrarouge #françaisDorigineContrôlée
I see people trying to spoil #TeenWolf. Try. And I'll spoil your faces. With boiling oil.
it's also an incentive to drink water
I DON'T GIVE A FUCK, AT #FLAPPYBIRD I SCORED 54! GFY @JohnDoe499 !
Terrifying! @JohnDoe726 Abderahmane getting called Abdou because easier to pronounce... #infrarouge
Finally out ... Funny the Nantes people provoking from 100m after the game. #FCNAPSG
#JV Even for my masochistic side, Flappy Bird drives you crazy. (record of 19 :/) To be tested! #flappybird @JohnDoe513 WWW33
At Flappy Bird when my Bird has 10 I'm so happy #TeamFail Loool
Zlatan, can't you wipe the raindrops from the camera? It seems they don't really feel like doing it!
I'm afraid of playing Flappy bird, my phone would be at risk of flying because I would be so fed up with losing
A guy in Sweden found Zlatan's credit cards WWW64
#ItAnnoysMeWhen when someone criticises ALGERIA!

It's funny, in flappy bird you don't touch the pipe but the bird falls down anyway. Ah. Ah. Ah.
Flappy Bird it pisses one off that game!! 👊👊
There's more rage on Nantes side than on Lyon and Marseille ones, surprised but that's funny :)
Hey people from Nantes what were you saying before the game? Little gift peasants #FCNPSG WWW69
then I go back to work and another crisis...
Well I'm off to eat! I don't think I will be back! #StarWarsV tonight! ^^
Fuck I have to watch the rest of teen wolf. And the last episode of ahs. So few time... :(
Yep!And it will be a nice gift for you too
#ItAnnoysMeWhen I see that someone tweeted an original thing then I see the same tweet several times. It demonstrates the plagiary. 
Of course no Teen Wolf and BatB yet I don't even know why I'm suprised
Zlatan didn't want us to go to bed late the naughty boy
tonight there's teen wolf&himym♡♡♡♡
#ItAnnoysMeWhen there's a surprise test @cauetofficiel
my TL is emptying then I get bored then I feel alone but mostly during holidays but it's not the case so it's not so important
#ItAnnoysMeWhen someone tells you "I have something important to say to you!", you tell her to tell you, she answers "I'll tell you later"
Fu**, what's with that shitty encoding. Have to download it again therefore to wait again. Aah it pisses me off! #TeenWolf
Zlatan must have uttered a "How come you feel ok messing with my buddy eh?!" #ThugMan
Flappy bird that game is going to drive me nuts
Teen Wolf I tried 3 times. I never went further than episode 1
I went through several police checks with verbal violence and it's not the urge to protest that rises in me #infrarouge

#ItAnnoysMeWhen no one explains to me what's happening in Alsace 😱
So here I know the problem is alcohol to begin with but it's almost impossible to stop with family with friends for pre-dinner drinks ect
Zlatan and Ikea they have to account for 99,9% of Sweden's PIB.
That's it. I've been spoiled about Teen Wolf.
above all don't be sorry!!
No but Malek Bounty is way off beam!! #Infrarouge #FrancaisDorigineControlee
so it was Sunday and I had to work the next day.
GOAL of Zlatan Ibrahimovic! 2-1 for PSG against Nantes! #CDL
#ItAnnoysMeWhen I seee this soab bird that doesn't know how to fly on the floor WWW54
Zlatan "Wait did you insult the algerian flag or what??" Djilobodji "Nope I was talking to Motta" -"Yeah right.Be a smart ass!"
we took 5gr of speed and all the md,
I only trust my desert eagle and Zlatan during overtime.
_URL Cllaude473: what's your best Flappy Bird score?! 41, applaud me. o/
Zlatan didn't want to play overtime! It's cold and it's raining and he would rather go home 👌😃
The fan thinks they won champions ligue or what? It's only an equalization! Zlatan please put a damp on it sir 
@JohnDoe419 on what website do you go for the last two teen wolf episodes please ?
my girlfriend didn't understand what happened to me and didn't care much
Bessat is so playing the tough guy lool, in front of Zlatan you stop being a smartass pal.. #StuffedCanaries
I say it again: Regarding Football, there are the Football players and the others. The others are Zlatan.
I want to play flappy bird but I know it's going to piss me off
#ItAnnoysMeWhen I'm bored I don't have no msg, no snap, no notif and when I'm crazy busy beh too many msg, snaps & notif
voices in my head don't stop from the morning till the evening...
Then the teen wolf's turn will come, and then there's still grimm and grey's anatomy
Hi friends, we're at @France2tv to live tweet the doc at your service #infrarouge
I still tell myself it's normal considering I fell flat on the face....

Well, I'm gonna go watch teen wolf I have nothing else to do at the moment
So much hatred in me. #flappybird WWW75

Now when you see someone in the hall with his phone, automatically he's playing flappy bird..
But it's true I drink easily when there's some right in front of me but I don't need to drink myself to death anymore, only a few effects are enough
Today, it may be the shittiest day in all my existence, zero fucks given because there's TEEN WOLF.
I have to watch Teen Wolf but I'm in training.
I'm a polyaddict with a big alcoholism problem,
Whatever happens we're all proud to be from Nantes despite the defeat! #NantaisForEver
and so all day long I'm alone except in the evening when there's my mother...
#ItAnnoysMeWhen I have something to say & 2 seconds later I forget it <<<<<<<<<<
Thanks to Zlatan who apparently also wants to see the doc!
while the Teen Wolf cast is tweeting like crazy, we are in class hashtag suicide and depression
Ok sure I want to watch teen wolf but tonight fuck

ZLATAN BRAHHHHH IN YOUR EYES BREHHH 💙❤️💙❤️💙💙
Tyler Posey digs teen wolf, I should hope so buddy.
Wallah this report pleased me so much .. It's a change from the negative pictures of Arab immigration that are always showed .. #infrarouge
I don't know about you, but seeing the joy of great players like Zlatan, Motta, Verratti I think it's wonderful 👌💙❤️🙈
Why did Falcao hurt himself?
I advise everyone with a, let's say a little narrow mind to watch #Infrarouge about the "Français d'origine contrôlée" #France2
but sure I keep in mind that it's zero alcohol!!
Does anyone have this problem?
A guy took a cab in Stockholm he found Zlatan's wallet, he just put it on his fb account WWW65
An american girl is completely spoiling Teen Wolf right now so I'm out!
Stop everything, it's beginning!
#ItAnnoysMeWhen I tell something to someone and when I'm done he says to me "eh?"
#ItAnnoysMeWhen I send tweets to my idols and they don't answer me fuck soab

it soothes me but the voices in my head don't stop,
This afternoon no high school for me I'm gonna watch Teen Wolf *,*
With the girls we tried Flappy Bird, we shouldn't have.
_URL JohnDoe932: Almost everybody's killing themselves on flappy bird in my TL lool I must confess this game is the bomb, it's irritating too

#ItAnnoysMeWhen I can't meet my idol.
Chill chill you sobs, while you're bailing out on me at the workshop my flappy bird score is just increasing 😏😎
I hit a few bowls then I crash out ,
if you understand me leave the same thing or have gotten over it I take everything that can help me.
if it's for the others that means we're not convinced we have a problem!!
the day goes normally
But why are Teen Wolf episodes so short 😭😭😭😭😭
When you lose you go back in the locker room quickly to take a really cooold shower
because I have to do it for me, hard to put that in my head,
currently I'm living at my mum's ,but I found a flat
Or else there are toll-free numbers or specialized discussion groups.
this weekend I'm invited to a birthday and I'm very very afraid,
I go out at 9h50 chill and when I get home goo and watch teen wolf

_URLerneremp: Zlatan everybody thought he was invincible, he was broken in by mavuba WWW42” FUCK THE LILLE PEOPLE RIGHT ?
At the high school you have on one side the couples , people from the frat house and then those who are playing at flappy bird
I still have my job,I don't have pals anymore except 2 cousin and my brother who are far away from me,
is it zlatan, or ibrahimovic who scored?
Hello everyone,
first I hesitated but then I thought come on take it(which I shouldn't have).
I'm weaned off alcohol since a few years, but I can't convince myself I will never drink another drop of alcohol, since I want to, not enough will maybe,
I'll try and be patient
it's also a thing I understood over the years, that if it's not for ourselves we won't make it..
if it's for the others that means we're not convinced we have a problem!!
it's true Cllaude531 has very good advice, helped me a lot for my codeine quitting!!
it's a bit more than a friend to me who celebrate his birthday,
I don't want people asking themselves too many questions, because a lot of them have labeled me when he's always been defending me,
now I'll tell you how it went.
Sooooo bad ahahaahah
weeeeesssssh what is this thing??
I'm preparing little papers for next weekend
