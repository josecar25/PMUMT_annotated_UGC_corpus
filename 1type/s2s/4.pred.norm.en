I just did eight to John John.
I just did eight to John John.
I used to take one or two times a month, but for six months, I can't control myself when I drink alcohol.
That's it. I broke up with John John.
I wake up a minute before the alarm rings.
He's the illusion of what he's not supposed to be the Republic of what's supposed to be the Republic.
I barely eat and fat as those who eat more than five people won't win 1g.
You've raised me so much with your John John I don't know what, but I'm gonna download it.
Oh, there it is, John John, right now it's motivating me a little bit more!
I can't sleep. I can't sleep. I'm going out with a bat. I'm going out with a bat.
Here's what I told you about John 90 minutes!
I'm trying to make John John the gays.
He told me it was normal, too, and it was going to go down,
Wait a minute, the nantays thought they'd go to prolongation?
I think when I come home, I can watch John John.
But if he dies, the show will be more the same... I don't know it's possible John John without John.
For my anguish attacks, he prescribed me from John an antixolitite antiximity at last,
We're taking out his private life when he can't even take care of France.
And my mother took it pretty well at last she knew I was fishy...
So I was forced to resist the product,
I introduce a friend of mine to one of my buddies, and they're making a page without me.

In John John when my John is ten, I'm too happy, Mrd.
But from Paris, double of John 1-2 we almost haven't seen him, but that's the class of the big ones!
panicked I'd call my mother... because the coworkers weren't here...
And it'll be a nice gift for you, too.
My John's empty after I get fucked up, and I'm lonely, but it's especially on vacation, but it's not the case that doesn't count too much.

But I can't live there because I'm having anxiety attacks.
I'm at the John and someone takes 20 minutes to order a salad or an ice cream.
I'm gonna go watch John John.
John, "What did you insult the algerian flag here, John, but I was talking to John - "That's what I'm talking about."
End of the afternoon, the evening arrives two other colleagues join us, and we decided to take the John on the beach (Personally I wasn't reassuring)
I'm looking at John, waiting for John John's subscription.
the day gets up and I start to fall asleep because I just realized that there was nothing,
There's no John.
Whatever happens, we're all proud of being born despite defeat!
Saturday morning after a white night I'm off to work just the morning at 9:00 in the afternoon,
I don't know you, but seeing the joy of the great players like John, John, John, I think it's beautiful.
Does anyone have this problem?
I just saw John and John I can't.
I just saw John and John I can't.
Don't worry, I'll tell you what I'll do when you leave me as a son of a bitch when you leave me as a dog at the workshop.

I'm currently living at my mother's, but I found an apartment.
This weekend, I'm invited to a birthday, and I'm very scared,
In high school, you have the couples on one side, the people of the melts, and then you have those who play John John.
I still have my job, I don't have a buddy except two cousins and my brother who are away from me,
Is it John or John who scored?
I hesitated at the beginning and then I thought I'd take it.
I'll set up some papers for the weekend, next weekend.
If I've seen you this summer to John you're too beautiful

Good memory, I think, will you come back next year?
Good memory, I think, will you come back next year?
A thousand thanks and to you as well as all of us.
They're polluting the John they're staying at home.
I don't even know she's had these 22 years, John.
Happy birthday my life I love you more than it's all for your 22 years
I'm psyching too much, it's just that it was just someone who got the wrong number I don't know I should've answered the fucking phone.

There's something that's selling me the most when I get my things ready.

It's up to you, John, even if I know somewhere you don't care, but I can't wait for you to get the prize.

I hope he doesn't get a message on his phone when someone writes a Faceboook message.

My sister's gonna kill me. I'm singing when she wants to sleep.
